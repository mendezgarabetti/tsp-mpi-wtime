This file describes the contents of the folder.

The 'input.dat' file contains the example input used in benchmarking
the program. It contains the positions of 20 nodes on a [0, 1] x [0,
1] grid, where each row in the file is a city, the first column
contains the x coordinate and the second column contains the y
coordinate. The coordinates are separated by spaces.

The 'output.dat' file contains the example output from running the
program with 128 tasks. The first 128 lines contain each task
reporting their final, best fitness. The second-to-last line contains
the fitness of the best solution found across all tasks, and the last
line contains the corresponding best path across all tasks.
